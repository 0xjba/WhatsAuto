In this workshop, youâ€™re going to create a Python program to automate sending Whatsapp messages, in less than 5 lines of code.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

Weâ€™re going to be using [pywhatkit](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/), a Python library for automation to make this project. This project also a Web Browser most preferably Chrome, to access Whatsapp web webpage.

Install the Pywhatkit library using the pip function in python.
```
pip install pywhatkit
```
Awesome! Now that weâ€™ve installed pywhatkit, weâ€™re ready to import the library to setup the environment.

## ðŸ’» Setting up the Project

Create a Directory for the project; Example: WhatsAuto
Inside the Project directory create the python program for automation.
```
import pywhatkit
```
Great! Now that weâ€™ve imported pywhatkit, we are all good with the automation part.

So lets send some messages.

```
pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg("+919*********","Hello, Buddy",15,00)
```
Just put the recievers phone number followed by the message & finally the time to send the message.

NOTE:
