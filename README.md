In this workshop, you’re going to create a Python program to automate sending Whatsapp messages, in less than 5 lines of code.

## Getting started

We’re going to be using [pywhatkit](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/), a Python library for automation to make this project. This project also requires Chrome Browser or [Chomedriver.exe](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to access Whatsapp web webpage.

Install the Pywhatkit library using the pip function in python.
```
pip install pywhatkit
```
Awesome! Now that we’ve installed pywhatkit, we’re ready to import the library to setup the environment.

Great! Now that we’ve imported pywhatkit, we’re ready to start setting up the whatsapp web for automation.
